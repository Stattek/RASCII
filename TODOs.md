## Feature
- [Saving output as image](#saving-output-as-image)
- [Braille charset](#braille-charset)

### Appendix

#### Saving output as image
- `v0.3.4 Rascii` only supports image to ascii (art) translation which can get a bit frustrating if you want an image as an output instead of plain text (in case you want to generate a pfp)

#### Braille charset
- The image is converted by buckets of pixels and then converted into braille characters which gives more detailed output
