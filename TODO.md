### Saving output as image

RASCII currently only supports image to ASCII art traslation which can get a bit frustrating if you want an image as an output instead of plain text (in case you want to generate a profile picture, for example).

### Braille charset

The image will converted to buckets of pixels and then converted into braille characters which gives more detailed output.
